# alphabeticalSort
A class that sorts a vector of strings into alphabetical order.

# Objective
I am using this project as a usefull tool for me to:
    
    a) learn more about c++ 
    b) how to solve problems in the most efficient manner both in terms of time and complexity.
    c) learn to write cleaner more robust and maintainable code
    

# To Do
Requirements that need to be complete before I would consider it complete

    - = not started
    # = started
    * = complete

    [#] - clean and simplify code

#Compilation
clang++ -std=c++14 test.cpp alphabeticalSort.cpp
